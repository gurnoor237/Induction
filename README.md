She talked about the importance of being on time and the need to start the morning calmly and in a spiritual way.

She interacted with students and made us start our day brightly and full of positivity.

 ### Dr. Priya Darshani
Then the first speaker of the day was introduced. Dr. Priya Darshani madam, been in teaching career for 20 years and currently studying and working on universal human values for about 9 years ,she  gave us a lecture on “Universal Human Values”. She made the session quite interactive and started it by asking a few students to introduce themselves and talk about their aims, aspirations and any type of problems. After this introductory round she pointed out some common problems in a student's life and started the session. 

She explained how the goals and aspirations of our lives are limited to physical facilities. We as students took BTech for a better future to earn money which is again a physical facility. The session continued with her explaining how running behind actual happiness in life is more important than physical facilities. Once one understands that happiness can directly influence the progress to achieve materialistic needs. Furthermore she interacted with students to know more about our point of views to the topics explained by her. One student questioned about “overthinking” and she beautifully explained that all the overthinking and anxiety is because of one’s tendency to chase physical facilities rather than actual joys of life. She elaborated more on this topic. Then she talked about other more important factors in our life than physical facilities which are relationships and right understanding of self. She labeled right understanding on 1st , relationships 2nd and physical facility 3rd on priority list. She elaborated the importance of the right understanding of ourselves which can fix the fights and improve relationships between family or workspaces etc. She gave us a home assignment to write about our daily activities and the amount of time we spend on those as well as classifying each activity in 3 categories: Physical facility, relationship and right understanding.She concluded the lesson by asking us to emphasise on finding what will matter to us in long run.
